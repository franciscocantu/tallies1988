Instructions:

The images are in the Training Set directory. You need to create a new directory for the Validation Set with subfolders for the clean and fraudulent images. You can use CreatingValidationSet.txt to transfer the files from the training to the validity set. Verify that the subfolders in the validity set have the same names than in the training set.

CreatingValidationSet.txt takes a random sample of 75 images for each class.

TrainingCode.py is the training code. It requires using Keras (available at keras.io)

ClassifyUnlabeled.py labels the images from the test set.

BashCode.sh executes the python code as a batch job in a GNU module (only if necessary)
